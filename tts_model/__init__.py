"""TTS model based on DDN architecture.

This module contains the TTS implementation migrated from the DDN image generation model.
Key adaptations:
- 2D convolutions replaced with 1D temporal convolutions
- Image tensors replaced with mel-spectrogram tensors
- Text/phoneme conditioning instead of class/image conditioning
- Duration/alignment mechanisms for temporal mapping
